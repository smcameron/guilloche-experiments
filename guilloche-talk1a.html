<p><b>What is Guilloche?</b>
(from Wikipedia):
<blockquote>Guilloché (or Guilloche) is a decorative engraving technique in
which a very precise intricate repetitive pattern or design is mechanically
engraved into an underlying material with fine detail. Specifically, it
involves a technique of engine turning, called guilloché in French after the
French engineer “Guillot”, who invented a machine “that could scratch fine
patterns and designs on metallic surfaces”.
