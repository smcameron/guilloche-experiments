<p>Because all the calculations for positions we've written so far are "pure" in
the functional programming sense -- that is, they have no side effects, no state,
and always produce the same output given the same input -- This means we do not
have to evaluate them with t increasing from zero to infinity.  We can in fact
evaluate things in *any* order, for example, randomly.
