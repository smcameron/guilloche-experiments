<p>So we need f(t) and g(t) to produce x and y coords of a rectangular path.
<p>How?
<p>As t moves from 0 to infinity, we want the path to move to the right
for a bit, then up for a bit, then left for a bit, then down for a bit,
then just keep doing that, going around and around.  So these functions
have some sort of period, repeating, well, periodically.
<p>If we just think about x = f(t), for x, we want it to begin at 0,
then increase at a constant rate for a bit, then stand still for a bit,
then decrease back to zero for a bit, then stand still for a bit, then
repeat.
<p>And for y, we want it to remain constant for a bit, then move up
(decrease towards zero) at a constant rate for a bit, then remain
zero for a bit, then increase up to it's original value at a constant rate.
<p>So how to do that?
