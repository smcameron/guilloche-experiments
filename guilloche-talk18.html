<p>By drawing 16 curves each offset by a phase angle of PI / 8, we finally
get a proper rosette:

<p>There's nothing magic about 16, except that PI / 8 is a 1/16th of a circle,
so 20 curves offset by PI / 10, or 30 curves offset by PI / 15 would work
as well.  In general: N curves offset by 1/Nth of a circle.
