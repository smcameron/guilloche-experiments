<p>What went wrong?

<p>Consider the following picture:
<p align=center><img src="what-is-the-problem.png">

<p>The arm rotates at a constant angular velocity.
<p>Is the speed at which the intersection of the arm
and the envelope travels a constant?

<p>No.  The farther out on the radius of the arm the
intersection is, the faster it travels.  The speed along
the envelope path is not constant.

<p>However, our generalized polygon code maps the period
to points along the envelope as if the speed were constant.
This is the source of the problem.

<p>How to fix this?
