<p>Ok, how about using our arbitrary path function to form an envelope?
<p align=center><img src="rosette4.png">
<p>Not bad!

<p>The outer envelope function is defined like so:
<pre>
    /* calculate outer envelope shape... */
    outerx = polygonx(t, period, starx, stary, tlen, npoints, total_len);
    outery = polygony(t, period, starx, stary, tlen, npoints, total_len);
</pre>
with starx[] and stary[] being filled out with the vertices of a 7 pointed star.

<p>We do have to be careful that the period matches what is used for the inner
envelope function and the drawing function.
