<p>In my first attempt at rosettes, I failed to realize immediately that
having the "wheels" was no longer needed.  Previously we've been able to 
use our system of wheels following an arbitrary path to produce interesting
images, so why not make the path the midpoint between two envelope functions,
and scale things such that we fit things just to the edges of the envelope
functions?

<p>Easier said than done.

<p>First, how to make the envelope functions?  This is not so hard.

<p>For a start we can use our arbitrary path system to construct
an envelope function (there is a slight problem with this, which we
will get to.)

<p>As another possibility, we can construct a circle easily enough:
<pre>
	x = r * cos(t * C);
	y = r * sin(t * C);
</pre>
Then, we can make r a function of t as well:
<pre>
	r = cos(t * C * M) * R + min_radius;
	x = r * cos(t * C);
	y = r * sin(t * C);
</pre>
Now we have a kind of undulating circle.

<p>Now, how to scale our drawing so that it fits between
the inner and outer envelope function?

<p>This is where it gets ugly.  The envelope functions are defined
by a few constants and by t.  t is used to determine an angle to
feed cos and sin functions to ultimately determine the values of the
envelope function <em> at that value of t -- which means at a
particular angle determined by t</em>.

<p>The path of the pen is also determined by t.  However, it is offset
in both x and y as the system of wheels spins around.  So the <em>angle</em>
which must be used to determine the scaling factors to use to keep the drawing
just touching the envelope functions is <em>different</em> than the angle
that the current value of t will provide when fed into the envelope functions.
There is some complicated relationship between these which was too difficult
for me to bother trying to figure out, esp. when I realized the examples of
rosettes that I was trying to mimic did not actually use systems of spinning
wheels.

Nevertheless, guilloche11.pde is an example in which I tried to make this work.
