<p>Now that we have a rectangular path as a function of t,
we need to make a wheel to spin
our "pen" around on as a function of t.  
How?  Remember sin() and cos() from high school

<p>sin(A) == Y / Length == "how much y", so y == length * sin(A)
<p>cos(A) == X / Length == "how much x", so x == length * cos(A)
