<p>In my second attempt at rosettes, I was more successful.   The envelope
functions are defined as before.

<p>The x axis of a sinusoidal function is then mapped to the mid point between
the two envelope functions along a radius determined by t.  The sinusoidal 
function is scaled to be between the range -0.5 ... +0.5, 0.5 is added to
shift it into the range of 0 ... 1, then it is multiplied
by the difference between the two envelope functions, and the inner envelope
function is then added to the result.  This forms the dynamic radius of our
drawing arm, which sweeps around.

<p>Perhaps a picture and a bit of math will help:

<p>The green line is the outer envelope function.
<p>The red line is the inner envelope function.
<p>The blue line is the radial difference between the
outer and inner envelope functions and is what the x
axis of the sinusoidal cyan lines is mapped to.
<p>The two cyan lines are out of phase by PI / 2.
