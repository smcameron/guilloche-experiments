<p>Up to now, the path our main wheel has taken has been a rectangle,
produced by a custom written function.
<p>We can generalize this to any ordered sequence of line segments to
produce arbitrary paths.
<p>the f(t), g(t) over the interval 0 &lt; t &lt; period cover all the
line segments, then f(t) and g(t) simply have to compute where t/period
falls in the sequence of lines.  Compute the total length of all the
line segments, add up each line segment from the beginning of the sequence
until the length/total_length exceeds t/period, and then compute the offset
into the current segment such that length/total_length = t/period, then
find x and y offsets from the beginning of the current line segment by
interpolation.

<p>Well, 50/100 = 0.5
<p>0.5 * 16 = 8.
<p>The first segment is only 7, so we're a little bit into the
2nd segment.
<p>How much into the second segment? (8 - 7) / 4 =  0.25.
<p>x = 5 + 0.25 * (7 - 5) = 5.5
<p>y = 5 + 0.25 * (2 - 5) = 4.25
